
; historical events and when they occur
;
; Events are followed by a category, and a label
; labels are used as lookups into historic_events.txt for title and body strings,
; and also as image names for the event picture
; If the label matches the category, they will act as "normal" random events of their category.
; 
; Currently supported categories are:
; historic         - Just generates a message
; volcano          - triggers the volcano nearest to the position specified if there is one on the map
; plague           - triggers a plague in settlements nearest the specified positions (accepts multiple positions)
; earthquake       - triggers an earthquake in the region of specified position
; storm            - triggers a storm over at the specified position
; flood            - triggers a flood in the region of specified position
; riot             - triggers a riot in settlement nearest the specified position
; emergent_faction - triggers the emergence of the given faction.  This faction must be marked as
;                    emergent in descr_strat.txt, occurs in the given region (position is not accepted).
;
; event descriptions are followed by a date (year as offset from starting date, and season, summer/winter)
; and positions or regions.  Each position/region specification must appear on
; a seperate line below the date. Most disasters require exactly 1 position
; (and unlike descr_disasters, this will NOT accept a region, even for events that convert the given postion into a region, eg earthquakes).
; The exceptions:
;   plague will accept multiple positions.
;   emergent_faction requires a single region, not a position (its the only event that uses `region`).
;
; `scale 3` Disaster events can have a scale after the position/region. The scale defaults to 1 if not provided (except emergent factions, which default to 160).
; For some events the scale affects both the radius and the deadliness (eg volcanoes), but for others (earthquakes) the
; event affects a whole region regardless, and the scale just affects the deadliness. Most disasters scale from 0 to 7.
; For emergent factions the scale represents the force strength, 160 is the default because that was the original hard-coded value.
;
; Events can have explicit visibility, via `visibility [everyone|visible|harmed|hidden]`, if not, the default varies:
; 1. `everyone` will always display a message to the player. This is default for `historic`-category events
;               without a position. emergent_faction also displays to everyone by default.
; 2. `visible`  will display to players who can see that position (or are harmed by the event).
;               This is default for historical events with a position or labeled events.
; 3. `harmed`   will display to players only if they are directly harmed by the event,
;               even if it's visible. This matches how "random" events work.
;               Note: plagues take a turn to get started, so if their visibility is `harmed` they'll never display
;                     the historical message (you still get the generic damage reports in later turns though).
; 3. `hidden`   will not display a message ever.
;
; `warning` Volcanos can give a warning, if warning is appended to the event. This warning is subtle,
; just some smoke from the volcano the previous turn. Remember if you set this that the actual eruption will occur in the next turn.
; You can always have a positioned historic event at the same time as the warning if you want a message alongside it.
